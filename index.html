        <h1> About Me </h1>

        <p> 
            <br>Hi! I am Nash T. Golosino, a computer science major student studying</br>
            <br>in University of the Immaculate Conception. So far, now that I am a </br>
            <br>2nd year student, my college journey so far is good. I'm now 19, and</br>
            <br>living my life to the fullest. I have a lot of things that makes me</br>
            <br>happy and sad. Yet, I'm determined to see through this all and wear</br>
            <br>toga in 2027 together with my classmates, hopefully.</br>
        </p>

        <h2>School Projects</h2>
        <p>
            <br>I only had few school projects, and one of the most memorable was</br>
            <br>the science fair in my junior high school days. We experimented</br>
            <br>calamansi as insect repellant, and we successfully defended it to</br>
            <br>our panelist. That was the school project that was most fun</br>
        </p>
